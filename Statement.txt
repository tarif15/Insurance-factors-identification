#The total value of payment by an insurance company is an important factor to be monitored. 
#So the committee has decided to find whether this payment is related to the number of claims and the number of insured policy years:-


# plot of payment and the claims

# plot of payment with the policy years

# create a linear model in which payment is the dependent and isnured and claims are independent:-

#since the coeffiecients as p<0.05 therefore Payment is related to claims and insured


# to look at all the variables

#removing the independent variable whose p value is greater than alpha i.e. 0.05:-

#The committee wants to figure out the reasons for insurance payment increase and decrease.
#So they have decided to find whether distance, location, bonus, make, and insured amount 
#or claims are affecting the payment or all or some of these are affecting it:- 


#aggregate the - amount, claims, and payment by Kilometres, zone and bonus


#The committee wants to understand what affects their claim rates so as to decide the right premiums for a certain set of situations. 
#Hence, they need to find whether the insured amount, zone, kilometre, bonus, or make affects the claim rates and to what extent:-
